# LSTM Music Generation
Marlon Grandy, Justin Zheng, and Oliver Wang
## 1. Introduction
## 2. Dataset
We chose [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi) kaggle dataset of classical music midi data, scraped from [this](http://www.piano-midi.de) site containing piano midi files. In the entire file, there is 290 songs, 19 composers, and 550,000 notes in total. When training our model, we used  subset of 45 songs, 5 composers, and 75,000 notes with 277 unique notes and chords.
